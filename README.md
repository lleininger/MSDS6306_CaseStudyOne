Case Study 1 Codebook


Study Design:

In an effort to analyze data on the beer market in America, we used two CSV files: one containing American beers and the other American breweries. We used RMarkdown to compile these two data frames together and offer some insight pertaining to the beersâ€™ alcoholic content and bitterness to present to the CEO and CFO of Budweiser.


Objects:

Beers: Data frame from Beers.csv

Breweries: Data frame from Breweries.csv

Q1: Data frame to show how many breweries per state

Beer_Data: Combined data frame to show all data from both Beers.CSV and Breweries.csv

ABV_Median: Data frame consisting of the ABV median by state

IBU_Median: Data frame consisting of the IBU median by state

Q4: Data frame that merges ABV_Median and IBU_Median

*Though we worked for several hours together reworking code and editing our presentation pieces, both the rmarkdown and powerpoint. It is unlikely there is any part of this project which was done without any collaboration or input from the other partner.
